# QETweaks

A collection of small mods for Quake Enhanced

## How to enable tweaks

Set "saved2" console variable before starting a server

1 = Axe does 100 damage
2 = Map `start` (Introduction) floor open

To enable multiple tweaks, simply add together the ones you want to enable
for example `saved2 3` before starting a server will enable both 100-damage 
axe and the floor of `start` being open.
