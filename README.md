# QETweaks

A collection of "tweaks" (small mods) for Quake Enhanced.

## Enabling tweaks

Set `saved1` console variable to desired value before starting a server.
If you want to change the value, restart the map.

## Tweak values

You can activate multiple tweaks by adding the values together (eg 1 + 2 = 3).

### 1: Axe does 100 damage

Just like it sounds. The axe does 100 damage.

### 2: Map `start` (Introduction) floor open

The floor/stairs that would normally open after collecting all 4 runes
(before the boss level) will be open on `start`.

### 4: Map `dm1` (Place of Two Deaths) weapons upgraded

The nailguns are replaced with rocket launchers and the super shotgun is
replaced with a lightning on `dm1`. Appropriate ammo is also replaced.

### 8: Double-jump enabled

You can double-jump.
